First of all: overall score distribution.</p> <p>We can see that more than half of the reviews gave five stars to the product independently of the price. The low proportion of 1 and 2 star reviews suggests that customers are very likely to be satisfied with the product they purchased.</p> <p>Let’s now consider the number of reviews by month of the year.</p> <p>The number of reviews seems to be highest during winter and spring and lower during autumn, with January being the month with the highest number of reviews. The biggest shopping time in the year is during the christmas holidays and we imagine that reviews are written the next month after the product has been used for some time.</p> <p>We can now start looking at the prices of the items.</p> <p><img src="/assets/review_number_vs_category.png" alt="picture showcase" /> <em>This is the caption.</em></p> <p>This is not a caption.</p> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/02-services'> <section> <img class='pull-left' src='http://placehold.it/500x500'> <h2>The Second Heading<span>Is Pretty Cool Too.</span></h2> <div class='lead'><h1 id="observations">Observations</h1> <p>In the abstract for our project we planned to investigate whether factors such as a product’s price or the season in which a review is written can affect the score given to a product. When analyzing the dataset we found that such correlations seem to be absent in the data and the only other feature that correlates with the review’s score is the sentiment score (positive or negative) that the review’s extended summary expresses. Furthermore we have discovered that in some of the categories the length of the review positively correlates with the price tier of the product, suggesting that users might write more detailed reviews for products that they spent more money on. It seems that just looking at the numbers in the data doesn’t tell us too much about what we want to know and we might need to conduct further analysis on the text of the reviews or the features of the product (such as looking at what other items are related to the one being reviewed or seeing if we can predict whether a review is going to be more useful according to which words the author uses and how high the sentimental score of the review is.</p> <p><img src="/assets/review_number_vs_category.png" alt="picture showcase" /> <em>This is the caption.</em></p> <p>This is not a caption.</p> </div> </section> <hr id='/features/03-contact'> <section> <img class='pull-right' src='http://placehold.it/500x500'> <h2>The Third Heading<span>Will Seal the Deal.</span></h2> <div class='lead'><p>Donec ullamcorper nulla non metus auctor fringilla.
